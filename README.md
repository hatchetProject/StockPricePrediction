# Stock Price Prediction

This project aims to do stock price prediction. As a project from the Artificial Intelligence, learning methods are used to construct prediction models. 

Different models are stored in the **code** file, including traditional methods such as Random Forest, as well as ML methods such as LSTM. Our best submission on Kaggle scored 0.00144. More details can be seen in **Report.pdf**. 

The training dataset is not included in the **train_data** file due to its size. However, you can find the dataset on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/c/cs410ei339-fall18-stock-price-prediction/data
